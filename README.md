## A study on NodeJS using Express with Socket.io

An express server is established together with Web Sockets using Socket.IO, a library for providing bidirectional communication channel between the client and the server.  

In order to run the app, download repo and install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/). 
Install dependencies using `npm install`

# Run `npm start`

The server will start to listen on the specified port. 

There are two files with names `client.js` and `client2.js` which represent two different clients. They are included in `client.html` file. 

Run the html file in the browser and check the console for further communications. Refresh the page if needed.
